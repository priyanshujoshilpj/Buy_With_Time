# Buy_With_Time
Capstone project
Great thinkers have a spectacular time to be more valuable currency than money. With this objective we have designed an online networking platform, BUY WITH TIME!, which allows customers to pay for goods with their time. The coins will be assigned to the customers according to how much time they have spent traveling to the stores which are a bit outside the city areas. The travel timeline and the directions followed for arriving at the stores are traced out by Google Maps.

Many customers spend a significant chunk of time visiting the stores which are sometimes away from the city. This project will serve the customers by rewarding their efforts by repaying them for the time spent reaching the stores.
