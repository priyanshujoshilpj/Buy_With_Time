# Buy_With_Time

Capstone project

Great thinkers have a spectacular time to be more valuable currency than money. With this objective we have designed an online networking platform, BUY WITH TIME!, which allows customers to pay for goods with their time. The coins will be assigned to the customers according to how much time they have spent traveling to the stores which are a bit outside the city areas. The travel timeline and the directions followed for arriving at the stores are traced out by Google Maps.

Many customers spend a significant chunk of time visiting the stores which are sometimes away from the city. This project will serve the customers by rewarding their efforts by repaying them for the time spent reaching the stores.

### Explore

In our app the user will have to enter his/her own location as well as the destination and then based on that information we will convert the data into tokens which the user will use for purchasing on the store. While operating the app the user will be shown the price of an object in two variables namely: INR and BWT tokens (upto a certain limit). The user/customer will be able to redeem only a certain amount of tokens on each visit.
